Some things in life are bad, they can really make you mad

Other things just make you swear and curse

When you're chewing on life's gristle, don't grumble give a whistle

This will help things turn out for the best

Always look on the bright side of life

Always look on the right side of life

If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten

And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing

When you're feeling in the dumps, don't be silly, chumps

Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

So, always look on the bright side of death

Just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a counterfeit and when you look at it

Life's a laugh and death's the joke, it's true

You see, it's all a show, keep them laughing as you go

Just remember the last laugh is on you

Always look on the bright side of life

  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:

Other things just make you swear and curse

All mimsy were the borogoves,

When you're chewing on life's gristle, don't grumble give a whistle

  And the mome raths outgrabe.

This will help things turn out for the best

"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!

Always look on the bright side of life

  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!

Always look on the right side of life

Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun

If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten

  The frumious Bandersnatch!"

And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing

He took his vorpal sword in hand:

When you're feeling in the dumps, don't be silly, chumps

  Long time the manxome foe he sought --

Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

So rested he by the Tumtum tree,

So, always look on the bright side of death

  And stood awhile in thought.

Just before you draw your terminal breath

And, as in uffish thought he stood,

Life's a counterfeit and when you look at it

  The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,

Life's a laugh and death's the joke, it's true

Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,

You see, it's all a show, keep them laughing as you go

  And burbled as it came!

Just remember the last laugh is on you

One, two! One, two! And through and through

Always look on the bright side of life

  The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
